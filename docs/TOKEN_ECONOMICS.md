# Token Economics

> **TL;DR** — CLI + Skills costs **~100 tokens per turn**. The equivalent MCP server costs **~1,800 tokens per turn** (down from ~3,500 before the upstream tool consolidation — see below). Over a real 15-turn task that's still ~85 % off the agent's context bill, before any savings from collapsing multi-step discovery flows.

## Where the tokens go

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph MCP["MCP server (~1,800 tok / turn)"]
        direction TB
        M1["20–26 tool schemas<br/>injected every turn<br/>~1,400–1,800 tok"]
        M2["Multi-step discovery<br/>find_type → get_metadata → call<br/>extra round-trips"]
    end
    subgraph CLI["d365fo + Skills (~100 tok / turn)"]
        direction TB
        C1["1 shell tool description<br/>~100 tok"]
        C2["Skills frontmatter only<br/>~30–60 tok each, lazy"]
        C3["One-call aggregators<br/>prepare · search batch · get batch"]
    end
    MCP -.->|same backing index| CLI
```

Every MCP request loads all tool schemas into the model context — there is no "load on demand". The CLI exposes one shell tool; the agent discovers commands via `d365fo schema` only when it needs them. Skills add ~30–60 tokens of frontmatter per `.instructions.md` file; the full skill body is only paged in when the agent decides it is relevant.

> **Tool consolidation cut the MCP baseline too.** The upstream `d365fo-mcp-server`
> collapsed its old per-type surface (~61 tools, ~2,900 tok of schemas) into 26
> discriminator-based tools; this repo's `d365fo-mcp` adapter exposes **20**. The
> schemas are individually richer (enum discriminators, longer descriptions), so
> the per-turn overhead landed around **~1,800 tok** rather than scaling linearly
> down. The CLI's one-shell-tool cost (~100 tok) is unchanged — so the relative
> advantage holds even against the leaner MCP surface.

## Expected savings

| Turns | MCP overhead | CLI + Skills overhead | Saving |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|  5 |  ~9,000 |  ~2,800 | **~69 %** |
| 10 | ~18,000 |  ~3,500 | **~81 %** |
| 15 | ~27,000 |  ~4,000 | **~85 %** |
| 20 | ~36,000 |  ~4,500 | **~88 %** |

Figures use the post-consolidation MCP baseline (~1,800 tok/turn). Real workflows save more — MCP also pays for discovery round-trips (often 5–15 kT per workflow) that the CLI eliminates with single-call aggregators like `d365fo prepare change`, `d365fo get batch table:CustTable class:CustTableType edt:CustAccount`, or `d365fo search batch <q1> <q2> <q3>`.

## When CLI does **not** save

| Situation | Recommended |
|---|---|
| AI host without a shell tool (Claude.ai web, ChatGPT web) | MCP — the bundled `d365fo-mcp` adapter speaks JSON-RPC over the same index |
| Single one-off lookup per session | Either — an MCP warm connection has no per-turn startup cost |
| Agent needs the full generated XML back in context | Avoid both — `d365fo generate` always writes to `--out` and returns a JSON summary only |
